👀 I’m interested in global finance, international economics, macroeconomics, and global trade. I also keenly observe climate-related policies and activities.  
🌱 I’m currently learning economics, international economics, macroeconomics, and econometrics, and I’m looking forward to becoming tech-savvy by programming in C++ and exploring the potential use of quantum computing in macroeconomics.  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on systemic risk, macroeconomic simulation, agent-based models, and macroeconomic theories.
